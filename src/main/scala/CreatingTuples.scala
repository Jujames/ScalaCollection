/** Tuples are simple data structure that makes it easy to group a fixed

/** Tuple: is an ordered collection of elements, could be a single element;
 *  could be a pair of elements, called a pair; a triple; a quadruple, called a quad;
 *  and so on.
 *
 *  Tuple are often referred to as n-tuples because in mathematics the collection can be any length.
 *
 *  Remember that you can assign, pass around, and return like any other type using either tuple _n
 *  class: Tuple2, Tuple3, Tuple4, ...., Tuple22 or the shorthand tuple syntax, you can mix the types
 *  elements, and there handy for quick low-overhead dat structure that don't have strong semantics.
